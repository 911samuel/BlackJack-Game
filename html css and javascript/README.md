# BlackJack-Game

Blackjack is one of the most popular online casino games.

HOW TO PLAY

Place a bet in the betting areas marked on the table. You and your fellow players are dealt two cards each whilst the dealer is dealt one face-up. If your first 2 cards add up to 21 (an Ace and a card valued at 10), that’s Blackjack! If they have any other total, decide whether you wish to ‘draw’ or ‘stay’. You can continue to draw cards until you are happy with your hand.

You may “Double” your original stake on any two-card combination, however, you will only receive one more card. You can also “Split” any pair (including any two cards with a value of 10) by placing an additional bet equal to your original. You will then be dealt an additional card to each of your split cards to create two new hands. If Aces are split, you only receive 1 additional card for each Ace. If you split Aces and a 10/picture card is drawn, the total is 21, not Blackjack. If the Dealer has an Ace as their first card, you may stake up to half of your original bet as “Insurance“. This covers your bet if the dealer gets blackjack. If the dealer does get blackjack (drawing 10 as their 2nd card), Insurance wins and will be paid out 2:1.

Once all players have taken their turn the dealer draws another card for their hand. They must draw until they reach 17 or more.

RULES

Once all cards are drawn, whoever has a total closer to 21 than the dealer wins. If the player’s hand and the dealer’s hand have an equal value, it’s a tie.

All winning bets are paid 1/1 but when you get Blackjack you get paid 3/2.
